          From the depths of the heart of Scotland, where the yearning for
          freedom sounds loudest, we launch our call.<br /><br />
          To keep the digital realm free, we look for individuals that value
          privacy. Our paths are carved through the urban fabric keeping the
          data for those who can understand its value and from those who only
          seek to control it. Embedded in the normal and hidden in plain sight,
          symbols and whispers guide our movements, leaving traces only for
          those who share our values. <br /><br />In this hybrid world where the
          data is often denied and censored, taken from us in secret, our union
          will fight against the chains of control. Join us where the physical
          meets the digital. “We shall meet in the place where there is no
          darkness.” <br /><br />Now we know how to find you and soon you will
          be called. <br /><br />It will be up to you to answer that call, if
          you wish, or to forget this ever happened and hear from us never
          again. <br />The time will be soon.
