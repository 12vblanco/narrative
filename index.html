        <p>
          From the depths of the soul of Scotland, where the yearning for
          freedom resounds loudest, we've launched our call.<br /><br />
          To keep the digital realm free, we look for individuals in search of
          sovereignty. Our paths are carved through the urban fabric keeping the
          data for those who can understand its value. Embedded in the routine
          of the normal day symbols and whispers guide our movements leaving
          traces only for those who share our values. <br /><br />In this hybrid
          world where the data is often hidden and taken from us in secret, our
          brotherhood will fight against the chains of control. Join us where
          the physical meets the digital, in the place where there is no
          darkness we shall meet. <br /><br />Now we know how to find you and
          soon you will be called. <br /><br />It will be up to you to answer
          that call if you wish or to forget this ever happened and hear from us
          never again. <br />Wait for the call.
